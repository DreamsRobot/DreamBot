# DreamBot
This canvas contains a complete, working scaffold for a Telegram group-management bot built with Pyrogram + MongoDB. It includes a plugin loader, core utilities, and a starter set of fully-implemented plugins (admin, bans, purge, warn, antiflood, welcome, notes, blacklist, AFK, ping, userinfo, stickers, wiki, etc.).
